		 * letter A = 65
		 * letter Z = 90
		 * max loop is max number of letters = 26
		 * 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * Get the number of letter supplied as argument
		 * subtract the number from 90, the result subtract from 26
		 * that will be the number of loops you have to make
		 * EXAMPLE: 
		 * 
		 * argument is C (67)
		 * subtract from Z (90)
		 * 90 - 67 = 23
		 * max letters (26) - 23 = 3 iterations
		 * 3 would be the highest point of the diamond 
		 * at index 1 print A = 65
		 * at index 2 print B = 66
		 * at index 3 print C = 67 (highest point)
		 * START LOOPING BACKWARDS
		 * at index 2 print B = 66
		 * at index 1 print A = 65 
		 *
		 * starting row 1 add the number of iterations as spaces before and after the letter
		 * 
		 * create a string made up of n copies of s
		 * String.join("", Collections.nCopies(n, s));
